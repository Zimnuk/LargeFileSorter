The chronology of hypotheses for solving the problem
1. My first idea is based on the merge sort method. But with some changes in implementation, to save time of development. First, we will split the large file into several smaller files, each comparable in size to the available memory. We will sort each of them and then merge the sorted files into one. For the merging process, I plan to use a data structure like a PriorityQueue, which will allow us to utilize a built-in algorithm for comparing multiple elements at once.
